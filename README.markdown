This project aims to be a useful library of reusable code for iOS developers.

To find out what is available you can run the project on Xcode or read the source code files specially the ones containing "Sample" on its name.

How to Use It

The list of dependencies is listed as comments in the header files. 

Requirements
------------

- Minumum iOS version: 5.0
