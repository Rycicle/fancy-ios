 * <h1>What is Fancy iOS</h1>
 * 
 * Fancy iOS is a collection of resusable code and components. 
 * The idea is to provide small portions of code that you can include in your projects,
 * Fancy iOS won't be a complete framework.
 * 
 * Feel free to contribute and comment :)
 *
 * <h2>How to Use It</h2>
 * 
 * The project isn't a static library or a framework that you add to your projects. Instead 
 * it's made by small independent (as much as possible) parts that you copy to your 
 * project and start using it.
 *
 * The list of dependencies is listed as comments in the header files. 
 *
 * <h2>Requirements</h2>
 * - Xcode: 4.0
 * - Minumum iOS version: 4.0
 * - See the Xcode project to see the list of frameworks used. As of this moment there's no external frameworks or libraries in the project.
